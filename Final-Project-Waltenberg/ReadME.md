The Chat Dungeon is a blog style chat room that has room for creating posts, uploading media, flagging bad or suspicious media for review and commenting on others posts. 
It additionally has things like user handling and Admin support functions to ensure that things are taken care of at the Admin level. 

Set-up - 
    Pretty easy this time around. Just upload the SQL document (dungeonDb) to your MYSQL and sign in. 
    Media contained in the SQL will be moved as it's stored locally through file paths. 
    Images, gifs, and webp's are handled, so no worry about those. 
    
Features - 
 -  User creation/Admin handling
 -  Post/Comment Creation
 -  Post Flagging
 -  Post Archiving
 -  Media Uploading


The Admin I used will still be in the SQL and will be (TestAdmin - AdminPassword)
